"""The reservation state machine. Every status change — user-driven or from
the background worker — goes through `transition()` so illegal jumps
(e.g. COMPLETED -> CONFIRMED) are rejected and every change leaves an
audit trail in reservation_events.

Detailed design: docs/architecture-and-decisions.md § "C05 Detailed Design".
The decision is two tables, read in order: `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` (is the
edge in BR-09 at all?) and `GUARDS` (the BR-09 guard column for that edge,
first failing guard wins). A rule change is a change to one of them."""
