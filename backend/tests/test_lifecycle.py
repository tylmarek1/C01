"""Tests derived from the Reservation Lifecycle's detailed design
(docs/architecture-and-decisions.md § "C05 Detailed Design"). Each name
starts with the id of the DD test it runs (DD-T1…DD-T9, table in
docs/evidence-and-evolution.md § "C05 DD Verification Evidence").

DD-T1…DD-T6 are unit tests: the policy (`check_transition`,
`check_cancellable`) is pure, so they run on unsaved objects and an
injected clock, without a database. DD-T7…DD-T9 need the real session and
PostgreSQL row locks, so they are component/integration tests."""
